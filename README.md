# Custom Node.js on dotCloud

This is a custom service recipe to run *any* version of Node.js on dotCloud.
To see it in action, just clone this repository and push it to dotCloud!

## Use it with your own code:

1. Copy the "nodejs" directory to your app  
2. Append or merge the content of dotcloud.yml to your dotcloud.yml file.  

## dotcloud.yml

* You can set "approot" to the directory containing your Node code.
    * This directory should contain "server.js" and "package.json".

* If you want to use a custom version of Node, just set "node_version"
as shown in the example. 
    * "node_version" is actually taken to be a tag in the Node.js github repository.
    
* If you specify "node_version", Node.js will be built the first time you push 
    * (it won't be rebuilt each time, because it will be compared to "node --version"). 
    * You can even specify "master", but in that case, Node.js will be rebuilt at each push.

Enjoy!

## Examples

### dotcloud.yml
e.g. if your current dotcloud.yml looks like this:  

    www:  
      type: nodejs  
      approot: hellonode # change this to your application root!s    
      node_version: v0.4.5  
      environment:  
        NODE_ENV: production  

you should have something like this to use the custom node app:  

    www:  
      type: custom  
      buildscript: nodejs/builder  
      ports:  
        www: http  
      process: node server.js  
      approot: hellonode # change this to your application root!s  
      node_version: v0.6.15  
      environment:  
        NODE_ENV: production  
        
**Note:** Whatever your previous service node service name was (www in the example),   
should now be a custom app. Any app that needs to use a custom version of nodejs will need to be a custom app with buildscript.

## Possible Issues

### Supervisorctl

If you see erros like this

    Error: .ini file does not include supervisorctl section
    For help, use /usr/bin/supervisorctl -h
    
You may need to specify a \[supervisorctl\] section in your *supervisord.conf*

#### Example

    [program:node] 
    environment = NODE_ENV=production 
    command = node server.js
    directory = /dotcloud/path/to/approot

    [supervisorctl]
    serverurl = unix:///var/dotcloud/supervisor.sock
    
**Note:** *supervisor.sock* may be listed in another location. SSH in and find it if that does not work.
